*Play as Alex and save your lover Arianne who got kidnapped by  the evil emperor! He wants to marry her!*

*Hurry up, grab your sword and get her back!*

*Created for Ludum Dare #33, "Almost Heroic" seems to be a classic  NES like J-RPG with a basic plot. Under its appearance, the game  denounce naively some videogame usual but harsh behaviour.*

**Ludum Dare** is a "Game Jam". The purpose is to spend **72 hours** creating a game based on a theme suggested by the community. Ludum Dare events take place every April, August and December. 

We decided to participate in the August 21st-24th session... just 1 hour before the announcement of the theme! :D 

Thus, we created this unpretentious little game, together on  skype/slack/github, deep into the very hot conditions of the game jam! 

The theme of this session is "***you are the monster***", we were all agreed to do a more *subtle* game than "control a monster". 

So we put our heads together for a small simple idea based on the clich√©s of the RPG, twisted into an original ending. ;) 

All the graphics/sound/music is original and have been done during the jam session!
